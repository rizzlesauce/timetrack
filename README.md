timetrack
=========

A web based time tracking utility. It consists of a backend REST node.js script and a front end web client. It allows the user to track time and activities performed over the day. It produces a report that shows sums of hours spent on various activities. The server allows data for multiple dates to be saved on the file system. To run, install node.js and execute the restserver.js script. In a WebKit browser open the index.html file for the front end UI.
